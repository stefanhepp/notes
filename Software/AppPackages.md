Application Packages Notes
===========================

General
-------

Linux Application Containers:
- **AppImage**: Most portable, smallest size, fastest. Single file, no installation required. No repository or automatic updates. Community project.

- **Snap**: Largest Appstore, slowest container. Application must be installed via snapd. Single central appstore only, driven by Canonical.

- **FlatPak**: Smallest Appstore, larger files. No real advantage over AppImages except allowing for individual repositories, enabling automatic updates without central store.
